## The first of all

This is the first working graphical game I wrote. It's here to provide a quick sample of what you can
do using a renderer, an event manager and a game loop.

## The game

Take the grey cube with your move and move it onto the red outlines.
When it matches up, you won a point, you can start again and again and again and again and again...

## Dep

This project relies on SFML, you'll need it to build / run.
